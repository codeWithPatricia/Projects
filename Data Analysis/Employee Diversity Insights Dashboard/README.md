### Project Overview
The Employee Diversity Insights Dashboard project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the diversity and composition of employees within a technology company. By analyzing various demographic factors such as gender, ethnicity, age, and job role, the dashboard seeks to uncover patterns, trends, and disparities in the workforce.

This dashboard will offer a holistic view of employee diversity metrics, including representation across different departments, levels of seniority, and tenure within the company. Additionally, it will provide interactive features allowing users to drill down into detailed profiles for each employee, enabling deeper analysis and understanding of individual characteristics and demographics.

Through this project, stakeholders within the organization can gain valuable insights to inform diversity initiatives, identify areas for improvement, and promote inclusivity and equity within the workplace. The Employee Diversity Insights Dashboard serves as a powerful tool for fostering a diverse and inclusive organizational culture within the technology industry.

### Data Cleansing/Preparation
In this Inital data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection.
- Data cleansing and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the Employee Detail data to answer key questions, such as:
- Number of employees based on race?
- Number of employees based on gender?
- Gender by department?
- Employee Hired Per months?
- Employee Hired Per source?

### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- The employee demographics based on race indicate a predominance of Black/African American employees at 53.64%, followed by White at 13.18%, Asian at 12.27%, American Indian/Alaska Native at 10.45%, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander at 10.45%.
- Gender distribution among employees shows that females constitute the majority at 63.64%, followed by males at 31.36%, and non-binary individuals at 5.00%.
- Analysis of employee hiring trends per month reveals varying recruitment patterns, with March accounting for the highest proportion at 30.00%, followed by April at 27.73%, and May at 12.27%. Notably, January and February show lower recruitment rates at 4.00% and 3.64%, respectively.
- Employee recruitment sources exhibit diverse channels, with the website contributing the highest proportion at 26.36%, followed by Facebook at 23.18%, Twitter at 22.27%, Indeed at 14.55%, and LinkedIn at 13.64%.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Implement diversity and inclusion initiatives to ensure equitable representation across all racial demographics, with a focus on fostering a supportive and inclusive work environment.
- Develop targeted recruitment strategies to attract and retain diverse talent from underrepresented racial groups.
- Enhance gender diversity initiatives to promote a more balanced workforce, ensuring equal opportunities for career advancement and professional development among all genders.
- Optimize recruitment efforts by aligning hiring activities with peak recruitment months, such as March and April, to maximize the effectiveness of recruitment campaigns.
- Allocate resources to diverse recruitment channels, with an emphasis on leveraging the company website, Facebook, Twitter, Indeed, and LinkedIn to reach a broader pool of candidates and enhance recruitment outcomes.
