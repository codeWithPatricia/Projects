### What I learned

Here are some key takeaways from this project:

- Improved understanding of **Tailwind CSS utility classes** and how they can be used to build responsive and aesthetically pleasing designs quickly.
- Practiced creating a **mobile-first workflow**, ensuring the site is fully responsive across devices.
- Gained more experience structuring HTML to be semantic and accessible.

Here’s a small example of code I’m proud of:

```html
<div class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-4 bg-gray-100">
  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Delicious Recipes</h1>
  <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">Discover the best recipes from around the world.</p>
</div>
