### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Here are some key takeaways from this project:

- Improved understanding of **Tailwind CSS utility classes** and how they can be used to build responsive and aesthetically pleasing designs quickly.
- Practiced creating a **mobile-first workflow**, ensuring the site is fully responsive across devices.
- Gained more experience structuring HTML to be semantic and accessible.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html and tailwind css
<div class="bg-pink-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6 px-4 font-outfit">
  <h3 class="font-semibold text-lg text-rose-800">Preparation time</h3>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-stone-600 space-y-1 ">
    <li><span class="font-bold">Total:</span> Approximately 10 minutes</li>
    <li><span class="font-bold">Preparation:</span> 5 minutes</li>
    <li><span class="font-bold">Cooking:</span> 5 minutes</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on improving my responsiveness skills to ensure that my designs look seamless across all screen sizes. Additionally, I aim to deepen my understanding of advanced Tailwind CSS concepts, such as customizing themes and working with utility-first animations.

I also plan to explore accessibility best practices to make my projects more inclusive, as well as refine my workflow when using tools like Flexbox and Grid for complex layouts. These are areas where I see room for growth and believe they will elevate the quality of my future projects.
